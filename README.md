# OSA-SE-SkyLife

Skylife is a communal place to work on profile xmls for all Skyrim npcs. I set it up with a basic list of popular waifus but currently they are all just using a template profile / gfx. The plan was to try to have as much of Skyrim's NPCs given accurate profiles and body tones as possible.

## Process
Colors and hues and clothing should be based on the character's iconic look, more exterme make overs from mods should be handled in forks unless packaged with the mod that is doing the npc makeover.

## NPCs in Mods
Since profiles take up so little space it's ok to add modded npcs into SkyLife also.

## Ref Folder

If you look in the _REF folder you can see an organization system to know how to find NPCs I also put a text document in with each npc so i can find their folder by name.
